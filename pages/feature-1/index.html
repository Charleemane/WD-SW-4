                <h2>Adventure of the year - "Frieren takes its time"</h2>
                <p>Frieren is unique when it comes to adventure animes, in that at the beginning of the anime, we start at the end of the
                <br>heroes adventure. The demon king is slayed, and the heroes walk their seperate ways. Frieren focuses on the everyday
                <br>lives of its adventures. Frieren allows fans to see the whole scope of their travels, rather than just the conflicts
                <br>and actions.

                <h2>Fantasy of the year - "Frieren takes the Fantasy genre to a whole other level"</h2>
                <p>Frieren is complete with traditional fantasy fundamentals that many have seen before. It is set in a medieval
                <br>world filled with races and monsters of fantasy. What sets Frieren apart from a typical fantasy series is
                <br>using those elements of fantasy in unique ways.

                <h2>Best Drama - "A slower pace builds up the strongest emotions"</h2>
                <p>Each scene focuses on the relationship dynamics and emotions of the characters, with each small detail the plot develops.
                <br>Frieren's story as an elf takes the film and the genre on a whole nother level. Showing us life in the eyes of an elf,
                <br>the anime underscores the struggles and growth of the protagonist as she learns how to live with humans.

                <h2>Best Animation - "Madhouse Studio went all out on Frieren"</h2>
                <p>In action scenes, the animation highlights the intensity of the fight, fast and bright lights blast left and right. But
                <br>on top of the loud animation, the anime also focus on the character's emotion and details. The animation and the colors
                <br>feel more like illustrations in a fairy tale book the audience emotionally. The use of colors in a surreal manner, be
                <br>it bright or dark, brings life to the animation and story. Throughout the entire series, the visuals remain soft,
                <br>upholding the anime's purpose of an uplifting narrative.
